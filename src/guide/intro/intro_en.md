This modpack integrates a variety of optimization mods, utility, quality-of-life improvements, aesthetics, optifine features, and bug fixes mods to ensure players can enjoy the best overall experience while playing the game.

## Features 🌟

The Reflection modpack is ideal for players who desire an enhanced gaming experience without the need to manually select and configure individual mods. It is especially suited for those players seeking improved game performance, visual aesthetics, and convenience. The pack offers a carefully curated selection of mods with out-of-the-box configurations to meet these needs.

> Note: Some features may be less commonly used or tailored for specific playstyles, and might need to be manually activated by the player.

### Performance Boost ⚡

Reflection modpack numerous performance optimization mods while avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary performance mods that might be incompatible with others or not suitable for certain hardware platforms. The aim is to significantly enhance rendering and game logic performance, as well as memory and hardware usage efficiency.

> Note: Although Reflection contains many performance optimization mods, it is not a lightweight modpack and thus may not offer the extreme performance benefits seen in other lightweight packs.

### Enhanced Gaming Experience 🎮

Reflection includes a wealth of practical tools and quality-of-life (QoL) improvement mods, such as Xaero's Map, EMI Item Manager, one-click backpack sorting, mouse gestures, and more to enhance the gaming experience. Additionally, considering the needs of redstone and technology players, it provides some commonly used mods in this category, like Carpet and its derivative mods, Masa's suite of mods, etc.

### Aesthetic Enhancements 🌈

Reflection adds various aesthetic elements, not just shaders, but also decorative mods for beautification, such as footstep sounds, improved third-person view, better grass, physical item drop effects, and more.

### Completing Optifine Features 🌀

Reflection uses the Sodium + Iris setup for loading shaders, which are representative of modern shaders. However, they do not support all of Optifine's features. Therefore, Reflection includes some mods to fill this gap, ensuring that almost all Optifine features are now supported.
